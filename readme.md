LinkedTree is a Java project that implements a graph, a binary tree, an R tree and a Hash Table. It allows us to compare the performance of the different data structures, and to see which one is the most efficient for each case.
</p>


## Features
- [x] Graph with the ability to add and remove nodes and edges, and to search for the shortest path between two nodes.
- [x] Binary Tree with the ability to add and remove nodes, and to search for a node.
- [x] R Tree and visual representation, with the ability to add nodes, and to search for a node.
- [x] Optimized Hash Table, taking as reference the Java HashMap class.

## How To Use
```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/bielcarpi/LinkedTree.git

# Open the project on IntelliJ and Run it (tested with Java 17)
# On the main() there is a detailed explanation of how the program works, and what
#  attributes can be modified so as to modify its execution.
```
